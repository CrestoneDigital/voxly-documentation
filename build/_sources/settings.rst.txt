Intents
=======

.. image:: ./images/settings_intent.gif

Intents allows the manager to create new intents to answer specific user questions to a particular skill. Intents are the mad-lib, or fill-in-the-blank templates that assist in answering user's needs. A skill made for locations may need a new intent.

Examples::
    
    `Maps`, and maybe `Directions`
    `Maps` may answer questions about where things are located 
    `Directions` still deals with locations but instead answers questions about how to get to those locations
