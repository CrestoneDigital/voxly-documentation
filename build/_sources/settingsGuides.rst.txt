---------
Add Value
---------
    #. Click "+ Value" (top right)
        * A new row will appear
        * Another grid will appear on the right hand side with a Name and Value column
    #. Fill out Value field 
        * This field is dependent of the slot. This value can be a verb (find, search...etc.), the name of a city or county, a department or office of the city/county, a noun, etc.
        * To add a synonym click within the synonym column next to the desired value. After typing the word press the comma key [,] to append the synonym 
            *Synonyms can help catch other possible user input in order to answer the proper questions*
    #. Metadata for Slots
        * If slots have additional metadata that can be used in association to a slot value, this would be added in the right hand side of the grid
        * This metadata is available for use in handlebar templates
        
        Metadata Example::

            Slot: US_STATE
            value: colorado (full name)
            synonym: [] ## no synonyms
            metadata: {
                name: abbr,
                value: co
            }
            ## in handlebars, 'abbr' can be accessed e.g. {{inputs.State.abbr}}
