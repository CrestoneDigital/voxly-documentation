Events
======

Help community members stay updated about current community events. By simply asking the skill what events are happening, a user can be notified of the most recent events taking
place near them. The Events section allows for managers to manually enter events with detailed information. The ability to include iCal Feeds is also available. Similar to News Feed, in Settings -> Events, the manager has the the ability to add calendar feeds. Fill out the required fields and iCal URL and sync events for local calendars automatically.
